# Plans and Ideas for Quilt Draw

What could be next?  Anything!
But something from this document is more likely than the alternatives.

## Tool Icons

Instead of radio buttons, we should have "tool buttons"
in the style of paint programs.
We are, after all, just a slightly weird paint program.

### Full Flip (and Spin) Support for Single Button

Instead of a single "flip" tool, have separate &harr; and &varr; buttons.
We should **never require** the secondary (or other) mouse buttons,
which may not be available for all users.

Likewise for the spin buttons.

(Each one could still do its alternate mode with the secondary button, of course.
The V-Flip tool would do an H-Flip then.  But as it stands, there is no way to V-Flip
without a secondary click.)

### Move Tool

Instead of the 4-way buttons in a 3Ã—3 grid,
have a move tool (a hand?) that allows dragging the canvas.

### Floating Tool Preview

Highlight the cell or block to be affected by the current tool.

### Block-Level Tools

Spin and Flip are relevant operations for the entire block,
not only cells.

## More Flexible Guides

Instead of off/solid, add "dots" (cell corners only, like PikoPixel)
and "dashed" line modes.

Is there a reason we didn't use Pickr to select the guide color?
Like so:

    âœ… Guides ðŸŸ¦

## Block/Quilt Tabs

Done!

### Multiple Blocks

The Blocks tab should let the user add more than one block.
The Quilt tab would then have a way to associate blocks,
whether that's a simple A/B checkerboard (and 2-block limit) at first,
or a complete set of tools for putting blocks on the preview.

### Resizable Preview

A new quilt setting would allow resizing the quilt,
instead of hard-coding 4x5 blocks.

### Print Tab

With tabs and especially multiple blocks,
"just hit Print" is not as helpful as it could be.
We should have a dedicated tab with all of the blocks in view,
and no cruft to hide with `@print` rules.

### On-the-Point Mode

Add a "quilt background color,"
and paint blocks rotated at 45Â° on the preview.

## Load/Save

As quilts get more complex,
it would be nice to be able to save and restore them.
