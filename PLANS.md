# Plans and Ideas for Quilt Draw

What could be next?  Anything!
But something from this document is more likely than the alternatives.

## Tool Icons

Instead of radio buttons, we should have "tool buttons"
in the style of paint programs.
We are, after all, just a slightly weird paint program.

## More Flexible Guides

Instead of off/solid, add "dots" (cell corners only, like PikoPixel)
and "dashed" line modes.

Is there a reason we didn't use Pickr to select the guide color?

## Block/Quilt Tabs

This idea is a pretty deep rewrite of the UI.

The Blocks tab would contain the editor, a borderless preview,
block color palette, and guide settings.

The Quilt tab would show the full preview,
along with the sashing/border options.

### Multiple Blocks

The Blocks tab would also let the user add more than one block.
The Quilt tab would then have a way to associate blocks,
whether that's a simple A/B checkerboard (and 2-block limit) at first,
or full paint/flip/spin tools for putting blocks on the preview.

### Resizable Preview

A new quilt setting would allow resizing the quilt,
instead of hard-coding 4x5 blocks.

## Load/Save

As quilts get more complex,
it would be nice to be able to save and restore them.
