    <h1>About mouse buttons</h1>

    <p>For convenience, I will refer to mouse buttons below as "left" and "right", since they are
        usually in these positions. However, it is possible for a left-handed mouse setup to change
        the
        primary button to the right, in which case left/right are reversed. Please keep this in mind
        if it
        applies to your situation.</p>

    <p>On Mac, an ordinary click is a left-button click. Holding the Ctrl or Control key and
        clicking
        creates a right-button click instead.</p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The paint tool has two colors: click the left mouse button for the left color, and
            click the right mouse button for the right color.
        </li>
        <li>Clicking the left mouse button on a color will set it for the left mouse button;
            clicking it with the right mouse button will set it for the right mouse button, instead.
        </li>
        <li>The "Spin" and "Flip" tools also react to the mouse button; the left button will spin
            clockwise and flip horizontally, and the right button will spin counter-clockwise and
            flip vertically.
        </li>
        <li>If the guides are visible on the block editor, then they will also be included in the
            download. Guides are never shown or included in the preview of the entire quilt.
        </li>
    </ul>
